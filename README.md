Hi 👋🏻, my name is <b>Sandro Sousa</b>, I'm a junior web developer getting to know a little bit more about <b>JAVA</b>.</br>
I'm doing a series of simple practices, in this repository you can find code about the different methods and <b>JAVA</b> skills I'm refreshing since the end of my studies.

I'm currently open for work, actively improving myself and looking forward to be able to kickstart my career and to 
surround myself with good proffesionals to learn from.
